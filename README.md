# S.O.L.I.D. Principles

The goal of this repository is to show the SOLID principles of OO design. For each principle, you can find two commit messages. The first commit violates the principle, and the second solves the violation. 

### SRP - The Single Responsibility Principle	

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

**Before SRP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/a5b15ce1897435e07d8cdc4f2d1f3ce9a634873e

**After SRP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/e78cb6489a5a792e7f13b1fe03ca35b2a6b29d76 

### OCP - The Open Closed Principle
	
You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

**Before OCP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/4a5bd9ddb181ed09110d622bc4533a23b2fd4f15

**After OCP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/aa9457243120c5e475113e61bc154afe0b58b900

### LSP - The Liskov Substitution Principle

Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

**Before LSP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/484b9edca5138d868082d23ef5a921d7b120f9f1

**After LSP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/13fdba8b580224b944d4594f6da499d047115ff2

### ISP - The Interface Segregation Principle	

Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

**Before ISP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/9ab937f488925c4abcfb2225ee44279213b7395b

**After ISP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/8b397461962255e025da4b9f4fb64d51f87dabf0

### DIP - The Dependency Inversion Principle	

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

**Before DIP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/1b61dfe740255b37c7fe849c5279568e1e6ce840

**After DIP:** https://github.com/danieltnaves/solid-principles/commit/6799090510f9474f331dcb10f43c1c3ad348fa48
